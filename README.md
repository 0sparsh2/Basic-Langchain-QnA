# Basic-Langchain-QnA

## Overview
This project is designed to simply provide you with a question answering chatbots using LLMs with the Langchain wrapper. Here we have used OpenAI base model as the Large Language model and you would have to provide your own OpenAI Key in the running model to see it function. The code's UI uses StreamLit and is hosted on HuggingFace spaces.

## Live Testing
You can checkout the deployed model on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/0sparsh2/basic_langchain_qna)
